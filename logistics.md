## Summary of Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, successful students will be able to:

1. **Understand** the mathematical foundations underlying machine learning algorithms
2. **Implement** core ML algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy
3. **Apply** appropriate machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems
4. **Evaluate** model performance and diagnose common machine learning issues
5. **Communicate** results effectively through visualizations and technical reports

##  Grading & Assessment

### Late Policy
- **Late days:** You get a total of 5 (emergency) late days to use on any assignment submission (except project). You can only use 3 days per assignment. Use them wisely. 
- **Penalty:** 10% penalty per day late beyond credit late days (including weekends)
- **Extensions:** Only available for well-documented emergencies.

##  Assignment Policies

### Submission Requirements
- Submit on Moodle - link provided on the assignment page
- Include a `.ipynb` versions of notebooks for code, and a `.pdf` for the writeup zipped for submission.
- All code must be runnable and well-documented

### Collaboration Policy
- **Assignments:** Discussion of concepts encouraged with your classmates. BUT you must solve and write the problems yourself. You can't submit duplicate code or writeups. If you've used LLMs make sure to state how and where. Cite any external resources used.
  
- **Projects:** Collaboration allowed with proper attribution. Groups must be approved by instructor. Individual contributions must be clearly identified in final report and presentation.

##  Communication

### Preferred Communication Methods
For general inquiries, you should use the course **Slack** channel to ask questions to your classmates and teaching assistants (you get participation points if you ask or answer questions on Slack). If you don't get an answer, go to the TA office hours when available; if not, come to my office hours. If all fails, email me. In code:

```python
def help_route(slack_answered: bool, ta_office_hours_possible: bool, prof_office_hours_possible: bool) -> str:
    if slack_answered:
        return "Resolved on Slack"
    if ta_office_hours_possible:
        return "Go to TA office hours"
    if prof_office_hours_possible:
        return "Go to instructor office hours"
    return "Email the instructor"
```

### Announcements
- Check course website regularly for updates
- Important announcements will be sent via email or Moodle

##  Course Success Tips

For assignments, start early - they take longer than expected. Don't procrastinate on reading and practice problems. Practice Python regularly, even for short periods. When you use LLMs, always write down how you used it and what you got from it. Use debugging tools and read error messages carefully. Don't rely too much on LLMs. Comment your code thoroughly for later review. Back up your work frequently!

Choose projects aligned with your interests, demonstrate your understanding of the course material, and show your creativity. Start with simple approaches before attempting complex methods. Document *everything* as you go. Test your code frequently with small examples.

To get the most from the class, come prepared with questions from readings and videos assigned in the schedule for class preparation. Participate actively in discussions and exercises. Review material regularly, don't cram.

##  University Policies

This course adheres to all American University of Beirut policies regarding:
- Academic integrity and honor code
