## Course Philosophy

This course is not about learning how to *use* machine learning tools—it's about learning how to *think* like a machine learning engineer.

At its core, machine learning is the art and science of modeling the world through data. We live in a world that is infinitely complex, and our task is to compress that complexity into useful, generalizable representations. This course trains you to approach problems with mathematical and computational abstraction—using data, models, and algorithms as lenses to understand reality.

Rather than focusing on toolkits or memorizing algorithms, you'll develop the ability to ask sharp questions, evaluate model behavior, and generate your own solutions. The goal is to build your intuition, fluency, and creative confidence in modeling systems from raw observations—preparing you to reason at the same level as the intelligent systems now emerging around us.
