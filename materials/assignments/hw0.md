## Problem 1: Data Collection and Analysis with Your Phone

This problem is designed to get you thinking creatively about how to collect and analyze data using limited (yet powerful) resources: your phone! You’ll be surprised at how much data you can capture with your phone’s sensors. You might be less surprised at how much of that data is shared with tech companies, fueling predictions about your behavior, targeted ads, and addictive platform design.

Ethical dilemmas aside, this exercise is meant to show you what the **real-world iterative process of data science** looks like:  
collect data -> define a problem -> analyze it -> redefine the problem -> collect more data -> try again.  

Not all data science is machine learning. Sometimes it's just about signal processing, statistics, or simple algorithms (e.g., Fourier transform, averages, locating objects in an image).

### Instructions

- **Use your phone as a sensor**: Possible options: camera, microphone, gyroscope, accelerometer, light sensor, screen, etc.

- **Brainstorm 5 ideas**: Think of 5 possible uses of these sensors.  
  *Write them down at the top of your Jupyter notebook.*

- **Choose one idea**: Collect data for that idea.

- **Solve a task with the data — without machine learning**:  
  Examples:  
  - Find the location of an object of a certain color (e.g., red purse) in a photo or track it in a video.  
  - Detect the tempo of a song by shaking your phone in rhythm (using gyroscope/accelerometer data).
  - Record a sound (song, speech, etc.) with your microphone and analyze it.

- **You may use open-source libraries**, but not machine learning models.  
  (e.g., use OpenCV for color detection in images).

- **Any resource is allowed** but disclose the use of LLMs by mentioning it in your notebook and describing how you used it. 

- **Work individually**: *No teamwork for this problem.*

- **Submit your work**:  
  - Post a link to your Colab notebook in the `#problem-sets-subs` channel.  
  - Include a short description (max 3 sentences).  
  - Your notebook should include your code, data, analysis, and any visualizations.

- **Bonus / Penalty**:  
  - Bonus points for creativity and uniqueness.  
  - Penalty if your idea/solution is copied from someone else.  
  - You can "like" your classmates' solutions. The most popular ones get an extra bonus point.

## Problem 2: Exploring Project Ideas with a Language Model

This assignment is a warm-up to get you thinking about **project ideas** and **datasets** before we dive into machine learning in detail. The best way to learn ML is through exposure to lots of examples. The more you explore, the better.  

1. **Chat with an LLM (like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)**  
   - Pick a topic you're interested in (e.g. music, robotics, aerospace, cybersecurity, basketball, Formula 1...).  
   - Ask questions such as:  
     - *What are applications of ML in X?*  
     - *Give me original ideas for a project in X.*  
     - *Where could I get data for project X?*  
     - *If I were to take a course on ML in X, what would the syllabus look like?*  

    Be creative. The more specific your questions, the better the answers.

2. **Refine your exploration**  
   - Push the conversation deeper: ask about product ideas (if you’re interested in applications/entrepreneurship) or paper ideas (if you’re more research-oriented).  
   - Once you get interesting ideas, check what’s already been done (Google, papers, projects).

3. **Create a project abstract**  
   - Ask the LLM to **draft an abstract** for a project proposal based on your discussion.  
   - This isn't your final project: it's just practice to see what's possible.

4. **Submit**: Submit PDF files of: 1) the abstract of the project idea, 2) the syllabus of the course you've generated, and 3) the conversation history you've had with the LLM, in PDF files to moodle.


**Enjoy!**
