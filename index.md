title: Introduction to Machine Learning
---

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, covering fundamental algorithms and techniques from linear methods to deep learning. Students will gain hands-on experience implementing machine learning algorithms in Python and applying them to real-world problems. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application, preparing students to use machine learning effectively in their future work.

**Key Topics Include:**
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Linear regression, Generalized Linear Models, and classification methods
- Generative learning and kernel methods 
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction: PCA, K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models
- Reinforcement learning 
- Foundation models and language modeling

## Important Policies

### Academic Integrity
All work must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged for understanding concepts, but assignments must be completed individually unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Late Policy
Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day. Extensions may be granted for documented emergencies. Students are given 5 (emergency) extra days to use on any assignment (except project) submission.
